# Rain-Guard

Stay one step ahead of the weather with RainGuard â€“ your personal rain alert app!
Rain Guard is a weather forecasting app designed to alert you when it's likely to rain. The app connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for a specific location. If rain is predicted, it sends you a reminder message using the Twilio API.

## Features

- Uses OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
- Automatically sends SMS reminders via Twilio API if rain is forecasted.
- Set a specific location for weather updates (currently set to a default location).

## Getting Started

1. Obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). This will require signing up for a free account.
   After signing up, naviagte to your profile and [generate](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) a new API key
